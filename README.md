# Shin Megami Tensei: Tokyo Conception (Unofficial)

Unofficial Foundry VTT system for Shin Megami Tensei: Tokyo Conception. **This is a fan project not affiliated with LionWing Publishing or ATLUS. Please do not contact them for support.**

**This system does not include a rules compendium. A copy of the rulebook is required to play.** You can get it here: <https://lionwingpublishing.com/collections/shin-megami-tensei-iii-nocturne-the-roleplaying-game-tokyo-conception-core-rulebook>

This system is designed specifically for Tokyo Conception; any compatibility with other flavors of the SMT RPG is coincidental. If you're looking to play a different version of the game, or you just want more flexibility and fewer assumptions than this system provides, check out Alondaar's more broadly-compatible SMT X system: <https://github.com/Alondaar/smt-200x>

## Warning - Prerelease

This is based on my original SMT: TC system, located here: <https://github.com/NekohimeMusou/smt-tc-v1>. I moved fast and broke things when I wrote it—developing it in tandem with a demo you're running will do that—and now I'm looking to make it more maintainable, more customizable, and less opinionated in general. It'll also make it easier for me to fix the *numerous* bugs in the original. Nothing in this version is particularly broken as far as I know; what's there works, it just doesn't do much yet.

## Installation

Paste this URL into Foundry's **Install System** dialog and go hog: <https://github.com/NekohimeMusou/smt-tc/releases/latest/download/system.json>

Alternatively, you can download and extract the zip file for the latest release.

CSS stolen from <https://github.com/asacolips-projects/boilerplate>, without which I might never have learned how to Foundry. Kudos!
Also a big shout out to Taragnor and his Persona RPG system, without whom I'd probably still be trying to figure out how to work Typescript XD <https://github.com/taragnor/persona>
