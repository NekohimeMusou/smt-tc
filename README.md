# Shin Megami Tensei: Tokyo Conception (Unofficial)

Unofficial Foundry VTT system for Shin Megami Tensei: Tokyo Conception. **This is a fan project not affiliated with or endorsed by LionWing Publishing or ATLUS. Please do not contact them for support.**

**This system does not include a rules compendium. A copy of the [Shin Megami Tensei: Tokyo Conception Core Rulebook](https://lionwingpublishing.com/collections/shin-megami-tensei-iii-nocturne-the-roleplaying-game-tokyo-conception-core-rulebook) is required to play.** The system compendium provides a few sample characters, items, and skills for use as guidelines or example workarounds for things that aren't well-documented yet.

This system assumes you're playing Tokyo Conception. If you're into a different flavor of the SMT TRPG, check out [Alondaar's SMT 200X system](https://github.com/Alondaar/smt-200x)!

## Installation

**Step 1:** Paste this URL into Foundry's **Install System** dialog and go hog: <https://github.com/NekohimeMusou/smt-tc/releases/latest/download/system.json>

Alternatively, you can download and extract the zip file for the latest release.

**Step 2:** Install the [Item Piles](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/item-piles) module and take a quick glance at [its documentation](https://fantasycomputer.works/FoundryVTT-ItemPiles/#/). If I could make this a mandatory dependency I would. It saves so much time and bookkeeping on looting and shopping that I seriously don't recommend using the system without it. Full support is built into the system, and the compendium includes a couple example vendors.

## Special Thanks

CSS stolen from [Asacolips' Boilerplate System](https://github.com/asacolips-projects/boilerplate), without which I might never have learned how to Foundry. Kudos!
Also a big shout out to Taragnor and his [Persona RPG system](https://github.com/taragnor/persona), without whom I'd probably still be trying to figure out how to work Typescript XD
